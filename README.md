- **Initial fork**

  Nothing new yet. My plan is to incorporate color selection elements based on [this StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15123193/html5-canvas-doodle-change-colour/15124410#15124410).

- **First Push**

  Wow, so this sketchy structs is something totally different from the plain JS one on Jay's website. I'm leaving `sketchyStructs.js` alone and adding my new code to `plain_js_sketchyStructs.js` in my first push. Please see and enjoy the original at [Jay Weeks' website](http://jayweeks.com/sketchy-structures-html5-canvas/).
